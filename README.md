SF Food Truck Locater
=========

Technical Track: Full Stack

Reasoning
=========
I choose Python for my back-end because I have equal experience with it and Ruby (Rails) and Node.js.  I'm not an expert in Python but I have experience with building a web crawler, setting up a RESTful server, writing deploy scripts and managining AWS tools using it.  I figured that'd be enough knowledge to get me through this challenge.  I chose Flask as it has very simple routing syntax and really all I needed was a few routes to communicate with external APIs.

For the front end I choose to use Backbone and Underscore.  I didn't really need the full Backbone MVC framework, really just the CV.  I wasn't managing data, really just taking API data and rendering it on the page.  The controller performs a little logic that I would've liked to move to the Python layer.  I used a little Sass to style the popup windows.  I used the Google Maps Api to display a map and pin food trucks.  I used the Yelp API to get richer data on the trucks than what was provided by SF Gov.
